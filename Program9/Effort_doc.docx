Additional Effort:

To make voronoi_example.html:
    1. Ended up creating the example from scratch while referencing some of the linked projects in order to better learn, undertand, and showcase the usages and mathematics of d3.voronoi.
    2. Created three interactive svg elements in order to demonstrate the different ways d3.voronoi() can be called and how Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations work.
    3. Sourced and implemented a formula to find the center of a circle given three points in order to show why the Delaunay Triangulation forms the triangles that it does (It triangulates with at least 2 other points where the circle defined by those 3 points will not contain any other points in the set).
    
To make voronoi_tutorial.html:
    1. Created a very basic data set that does not randomize in order to provide a consistent visualization of basic d3.voronoi commands. 
    2. Included an English instruction commented at the top of the file on minimum neccesary steps to create a voronoi diagram and/or Delaunay Triangulation.
